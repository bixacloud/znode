# How to Transfer a Domain to Znode

If you currently have a website with another hosting provider, you may be wondering how to transfer everything to Znode. To answer this, it's important to understand the difference between a domain registration and a hosting account.

## Understanding the Difference

| Component | What It Does | Provider |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Domain Registration** | Gives you ownership of a domain name (e.g., `example.com`) and enables services like websites and email | Domain registrar (e.g., Spaceship, Namecheap) |
| **Hosting Account** | Provides space to upload and run your website | Hosting provider (e.g., Znode) |

To have a working website, you need **both** a hosting account and a domain registration (unless you're using a free subdomain). Some companies bundle both services together, but it's almost always possible to use different providers for each.

## Transferring Your Website

To transfer your website content to Znode, you need to migrate its files and databases.

See: [How to migrate your website to Znode](#) *(migration guide)*

## About Domain Registration

**Znode does not provide domain registration services.**

If you have your own domain (or want to get one), you'll need to register it with a separate domain registrar. We recommend registrars that allow custom nameservers, such as:

- Spaceship
- Namecheap
- Google Domains
- Any registrar that supports custom nameservers

Once you've registered your domain with a provider you like, you can link it to your Znode account.

See: [How to add your own domain to your account](How%20to%20add%20your%20own%20domain%20to%20your%20account.md)

## Quick Summary

| Task | What to Do |
|------|------------|
| Transfer website files and databases | Migrate content to your Znode hosting account |
| Keep your domain | Continue using your current registrar |
| Get a new domain | Register with any domain registrar |
| Connect domain to Znode | Point nameservers or DNS records to Znode |

## Important Notes

- You don't need to transfer your domain registration to use it with Znode
- Just point your domain's nameservers to Znode's nameservers
- Your domain stays registered with your current registrar
- Znode only provides the hosting; domain management remains with your registrar
