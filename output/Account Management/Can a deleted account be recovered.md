# Can a Deleted Account Be Recovered?

Znode automatically deletes accounts that have been suspended or deactivated for some time. Accounts may be deactivated for inactivity, because you requested it, or due to abuse.

---

## Is Your Account Deleted?

First, check your client area.

| Status | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| Listed (active or suspended) | Account is NOT deleted; no data has been lost |
| Not listed | Account has been fully deleted and cannot be recovered |

If your account is suspended, you can either have it reactivated or request a backup.

## Can I Get My Files After Deletion?

**No.** Once an account is deleted, it's completely removed from the servers.

### What Gets Erased

- All files
- All databases
- All settings and configurations
- All other content

### What Happens to Domains

- Domain names are released
- They become available for other accounts to use
- For free subdomains, **anyone can claim your old subdomain**

## Important

**Do not contact support about restoring deleted accounts.** If your account is deleted, it's gone, and there is nothing anyone can do.

## Deleted vs. Deactivated/Suspended

| Status | Visible in Client Area | Data Preserved | Can Be Restored |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Deactivated | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Suspended | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Possibly |
| Deleted | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

If an account was previously suspended and has now disappeared from your client area, it has most likely been deleted and cannot be recovered.
