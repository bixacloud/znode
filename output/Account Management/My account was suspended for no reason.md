# My Account Was Suspended for No Reason

Sometimes an account may be suspended seemingly out of the blue, with a vague description like "abuse." If you believe your account didn't violate any rule, this lack of detail may feel like being suspended for no reason.

**However, this is simply not true.**

## The Truth About Suspensions

**ZNODE NEVER SUSPENDS ANY ACCOUNT WITHOUT PROBABLE REASON.**

Every time we suspend a hosting account, we do so for a reason. You may not be aware of the reason or agree with it, but that doesn't mean the reason doesn't exist.

Fortunately, we have procedures so you can get more information, have your account reactivated, or access your account's contents.

## Common Reasons You Might Perceive as "No Reason"

### 1. You Weren't Aware of a Rule You Violated

Znode has rules described in our Terms of Service. Before creating an account, you must acknowledge you've read and agreed to these terms.

Unlike most companies, we try to make our legal documents concise and easy to understand. If you clicked "Agree" without reading, you may not know the rules you violated.

**Recommendation:** Read our Terms of Service to understand what is and isn't allowed.

### 2. You Weren't Aware of Abusive Content on Your Account

Sometimes, free themes and plugins downloaded online contain:
- Malware
- Back doors
- Hacking tools
- Other malicious code

This malicious code is often hidden, so you may not realize you're uploading viruses to your website. Even if you're unaware, such code can endanger you, your website, and your visitors.

**How We Protect You:**

All websites on Znode are automatically scanned for harmful content. These scanners:
- Go deeper than most website owners can see
- Detect known harmful software
- May automatically delete malicious files
- May suspend accounts to prevent harm

**Note:** Desktop virus scanners often don't detect website viruses well—they're designed for computer threats, not website threats. Your scanner's approval doesn't guarantee your website code is safe.

If this happens to you, submit an account review request and staff will tell you what to do next.

### 3. Your Account Was Incorrectly Flagged

Most suspensions happen automatically through abuse detection systems. These systems scan websites faster and more thoroughly than any human, taking down dangerous content before hackers can cause harm.

However, like all automated systems, they're not perfect:
- They don't catch everything harmful
- They may occasionally flag safe websites

**If you believe your website was incorrectly flagged:** Submit a review request from your client area. Staff will review and reactivate your account if it's safe.

## How to Get Your Account Reactivated

Accounts suspended for "abuse" are **never automatically reactivated** and must be reviewed by staff.

### Submit a Review Request

1. Log in to the client area
2. Find your suspended account in the list
3. Click **Submit Support Ticket**
4. Provide information about your website

**Important:** We only handle suspension requests submitted through the client area ticket system to discuss details privately.

## Summary

| Situation | What to Do |
|-----------|------------|
| Didn't know the rules | Read Terms of Service; submit review request |
| Malware from themes/plugins | Clean your site; submit review request |
| False positive | Submit review request; staff will verify |

Don't assume "no reason" means we made a mistake. There's always a reason—you may just not be aware of it yet.
