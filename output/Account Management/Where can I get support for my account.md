# Where Can I Get Support for My Account?

If you have questions about Znode, our services, or need help getting your website up and running, we provide a **community support forum** where you can ask questions. Staff and community members can help you, and many questions have already been answered—so search the forum first before posting.

**Important:** Znode does not provide email support, phone support, ticket support, chat support, or other one-on-one support for free hosting services.

## Why Is There No One-on-One Support?

### It's Not That We Don't Care

We provide support through our community forum. Staff reviews all questions and provides help where necessary. We also have helpful volunteers who may answer your questions even faster.

We regularly receive positive feedback about our support quality. We just don't provide private one-on-one support.

### The Economics of Free Hosting

The biggest cost for most hosting companies is staff salaries, and the largest portion goes to customer support teams.

Znode provides completely free hosting. We don't charge free hosting users anything—ever. Our only revenue comes from advertisements on our own websites and control panels. We don't even put ads on your site!

To provide free hosting sustainably, we must keep costs low. Since support staff is the biggest expense, Znode doesn't have a dedicated customer support team.

## Special Cases

### My Account Is Suspended

Check your client area for more information. If your account needs review, you can submit a ticket from there.

**Do not** use the forum or general contact email for suspension questions—they cannot help you.

### My Website Is Down

There are many reasons why you might not see your website:
- Server issues
- Bad configuration
- Software bugs
- Problems with your own computer or internet connection

Many issues cannot be fixed by Znode staff. We can't fix your browser, and we're not experts on all the thousands of software packages you can host.

**As the website administrator, it's your responsibility to diagnose and fix such issues.**

If you want hosting-side help, create a forum discussion describing your issue. People familiar with hosting and your software may be able to help.

### Your Server Is Down

We take server issues seriously and work to resolve them quickly. However, we cannot:
- Review large numbers of individual issue reports
- Personally inform hundreds of thousands of users

Staff regularly checks the forum for system-wide issues. Check there for updates!

## Do I Get Support with Premium Hosting?

**Absolutely!** With premium hosting, you get access to a support system where you can talk directly with premium hosting staff who will help you get up and running.
