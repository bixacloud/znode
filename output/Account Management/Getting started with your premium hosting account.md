# Getting Started with Your Premium Hosting Account

Congratulations on upgrading to premium hosting! Here's what you need to know to make the most of your upgrade.

---

## You Are Now a Customer of iFastNet

Znode is a free hosting provider sponsored by iFastNet. Znode does not provide premium hosting services. The premium hosting advertised on Znode's website and panels is provided by **iFastNet**, a separate company.

### For Premium Hosting Questions

Contact iFastNet's support staff through their support portal: [https://support.ifastnet.com/](https://support.ifastnet.com/)

**Note:** You'll need to create a separate account for the support portal. Logins are not linked to the Znode client area or iFastNet billing portal.

## Website Migration

iFastNet's premium hosting system is mostly separate from Znode's free hosting. This means:

| What Happens | What Doesn't Happen |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Free hosting accounts remain untouched | Accounts are NOT upgraded in-place |
| You can have free and premium accounts simultaneously | Websites are NOT automatically moved |

### To Enjoy Premium Features

Your website needs to be migrated to iFastNet's premium servers. **iFastNet can migrate your website at any time**, even if your account is suspended.

### How to Request Migration

1. Create an account on iFastNet's support portal: [https://support.ifastnet.com/](https://support.ifastnet.com/)
2. Open a new support ticket
3. Include:
   - Domain name of your new premium account
   - Invoice number of your premium order
   - Statement that you want your website migrated from free hosting
   - Username of your free hosting account (e.g., `znode_12345678`)
4. Submit the ticket and wait for iFastNet to migrate your website

**Note:** After migration, it can still take a few hours for your website to work again due to DNS caching.
