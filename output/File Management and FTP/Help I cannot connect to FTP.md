# Help, I Cannot Connect to FTP

FTP access is essential for managing your website files. If you're having trouble connecting, try these solutions.

---

## 1. Log In to Your Control Panel First

After your account is created or reactivated after a suspension, you may need to log in to the control panel once to enable FTP access.

1. Log in to the client area
2. Go to the **Accounts** list
3. Click **Manage** next to your account
4. Click the **Control Panel** button

After logging in to the control panel, try reconnecting to FTP.

## 2. Verify Your Credentials

Double-check that you're using the correct FTP credentials.

**Find your credentials:**
1. Go to the client area → **Accounts** list
2. Click **Manage** next to your account
3. Look for the **FTP Details** table showing hostname, username, and password

**Important:** Your FTP password is NOT the same as your client area password. The FTP password is randomly generated by default.

## 3. Change Your Account Password

Sometimes the hosting account password doesn't synchronize correctly across all services. Changing it can force a proper reset.

1. Log in to the client area
2. Go to **Accounts** → **Manage** next to your account
3. Click **Edit Account**
4. Scroll to **Hosting Account Password** and set a new password
5. Log in to the control panel once to ensure FTP access is enabled
6. Try reconnecting to FTP with the new password

## 4. Check Router FTP ALG Settings

Some routers apply an Application Layer Gateway (ALG) to FTP connections, which can cause issues.

| ALG Status | Try This |
|------------|----------|
| Enabled | Disable it and try again |
| Disabled | Enable it and try again |

FTP ALG intercepts and manipulates FTP traffic, which can cause unexpected connection problems.

## 5. Check You're Connecting to the Right IP Address

Some internet providers (like BT Internet and Plusnet in the UK) have Parental Controls that block DNS queries to `ftpupload.net`.

**How to check (FileZilla):**

Look for a line like this in the logs:
```
Connecting to 185.27.134.11:21...
```

If you see a **different IP address**, your DNS lookups are being intercepted.

**Solutions:**
- Use hostname `ftp.znode.app` instead
- Use IP address `185.27.134.11` directly
- Disable Parental Controls on your connection

## 6. Try Using a VPN

Some network administrators or internet providers block FTP connections entirely. A VPN can bypass these restrictions.
