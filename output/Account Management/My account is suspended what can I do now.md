# My Account Is Suspended, What Can I Do Now?

If your account is suspended, you cannot log in to your control panel, use FTP, or visit your website. The first step is understanding why your account was suspended. There are three types of suspensions.

---

## 1. Suspended on Request or Inactivity

Your account will be deactivated if:
- You used the **Deactivate Account** option in your client area
- Your account hasn't received any visitors in 20-60 days

### How to Reactivate

1. Log in to your client area
2. Click **Manage** next to the deactivated account
3. Click the **Reactivate** button

**Note:** Deactivated accounts are deleted after some time if not reactivated.

## 2. Suspended for Hitting Daily Limits

To prevent any single account from overloading the servers, Znode has daily limits on processing power, memory, hits, and other resources. If you exceed these limits, your account is automatically suspended for 24 hours.

### What to Do

- Check your account in the client area to see which limit you triggered
- Learn what that limit means and how to reduce your usage
- **Wait for automatic reactivation** after 24 hours

**Important:**
- Do not request early reactivation—no one can do this
- After 24 hours, allow up to 30 minutes for reactivation to complete
- Do not submit support requests if your site isn't back exactly at the 24-hour mark

## 3. Suspended Because of Abuse

Znode uses both manual and automatic methods to detect and take down potential abuse, protecting our servers from illegal activities and overload.

### If You Believe Your Account Is Safe

You can submit a request to have your account reviewed by staff. If your account is safe, it will be reactivated.

### How to Request a Review

1. Log in to your client area
2. Click the suspended account in the list
3. Click **Submit Support Ticket**
4. Select your domain, enter your message, and click **Submit Ticket**

Staff will typically review your account within a few hours.

**Note:** If multiple accounts were suspended, submit separate tickets for each account you want reactivated.
