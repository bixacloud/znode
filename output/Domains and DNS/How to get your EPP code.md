# How to Get Your EPP Code

If you're looking to transfer your website to another provider, they may ask you to provide an EPP code (also called Transfer Authorization Code).

**We cannot provide you with this code.**

---

## Why We Can't Help

An EPP code is used to transfer a **domain name registration**. This code should be provided by your **domain registrar**—the company where you registered your domain name.

**Znode is not a domain registrar.** We provide website hosting, not domain registration services.

## Understanding the Difference

| Service | What It Is | Who Provides It |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Domain Registration | Ownership of a domain name | Domain registrar (Namecheap, Spaceship, etc.) |
| Website Hosting | Space to upload your website | Hosting provider (Znode) |
| EPP Code | Token to transfer domain registration | Domain registrar |

An EPP code is **not relevant** when:
- Transferring a website (files and databases)
- Switching the hosting service for a domain
- Pointing a domain to a different hosting provider

## Where to Get Your EPP Code

If you're using a custom domain on Znode, you registered it with another company. That company can provide your EPP code.

### Don't Know Your Registrar?

Use a WHOIS lookup tool to find out which company registered your domain.

## About Free Subdomains

Znode provides free subdomains (like `yoursite.znode.app`), but these **cannot be transferred** to other hosting providers. Free subdomains are only usable within the Znode platform.

## Summary

| If You Need To... | What to Do |
|-------------------|------------|
| Transfer domain to another registrar | Get EPP code from your current registrar |
| Move website to another host | Migrate files and databases, then update nameservers |
| Use domain with Znode | Point nameservers to Znode |
