# Why Is It All Free? What's the Catch?

You may be wondering: why is Znode completely free? Are there hidden costs? What's the catch?

Znode is genuinely free. Here's how we make it work.

## Our Costs Are Low

Znode is powered by iFastNet. Over the decades, iFastNet has developed a unique cloud hosting solution that allows hosting many more accounts per server than traditional hosting software—while keeping websites fast or even faster than other providers.

Because of this technology, the server costs for individual accounts are very low.

Additionally, we only provide community support with Znode. Without an expensive support team answering common questions, all our staff can focus on improving the service.

**Result:** Our operational costs are very low.

## Fair Usage Restrictions Keep Accounts Equal

Znode is great for:
- Hobby websites
- Testing and development
- Learning web development

What's **not supported:**
- Complex web applications
- High-traffic sites

These restrictions ensure no account uses excessive server power, keeping free hosting viable for the majority of users.

## We Pay for It Using Ads

We display banner advertisements on:
- Our own website
- Client area
- Control panel
- Forum

iFastNet, who maintains the hosting system, also displays their own ads (like upgrade offers in the control panel).

It may seem hard to believe, but **these advertisements are enough to cover our costs**.

### No Forced Ads on Your Website

We do **not** put ads on your website. Costs are low enough that forcing ads on user sites isn't necessary. All reputable free hosting providers operate this way.

## How You Can Support Znode
