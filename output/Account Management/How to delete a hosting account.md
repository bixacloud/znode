# How to Delete a Hosting Account

If you've moved your website to another provider or simply don't need a hosting account anymore, you can delete it from the client area.

## Deleting Your Account

Hosting accounts must be **deactivated** before they can be **deleted**. Deactivating your account will:
- Take down all websites on it
- Remove all domain names
- **Retain** your files, databases, and other settings until fully deleted

### Step 1: Deactivate the Account

1. Log in to the client area
2. Go to the **Accounts** list
3. Click the account you want to delete
4. Go to **Account Settings** in the sidebar
5. Scroll down to **Deactivate Account**
6. Click the deactivate button and confirm
7. Wait for deactivation to complete (usually about 10 minutes)

### Step 2: Delete the Account

Once deactivated, you can delete the account permanently.

1. Log in to the client area
2. Go to the **Accounts** list
3. Click the deactivated account
4. Go to **Account Settings** in the sidebar
5. Scroll down to **Delete Account**
6. Click the delete button and confirm
7. Wait for deletion to complete

**Note:** If you don't delete manually, deactivated accounts are automatically deleted after 60 days.

## Changed Your Mind?

If you deactivate but haven't deleted yet, you can **reactivate** the account from the same Account Settings page—as long as you have fewer than three active accounts.

## If Your Account Is Suspended

### Suspended for Daily Limit

Your account will automatically reactivate after 24 hours. Once the suspension is lifted, you can deactivate and delete as described above.

### Suspended for Abuse

| Manual deactivation/deletion | Not possible |
| Automatic deletion | After 60 days |
| Domain names | Locked; cannot be removed or reused on our platform |
